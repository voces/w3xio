**Privacy Policy for WC3 Live Lobbies Discord Bot**

1. **Data Collection**\
   WC3 Live Lobbies scans messages in Discord channels and direct messages (DMs)
   solely to detect mentions and commands related to the bot. No messages are
   stored long-term. However, they may be temporarily cached or logged for
   operational purposes.

2. **Command Data Storage**\
   When a command is issued, certain data may be stored, including information
   about channels, servers, and DMs where the bot is used. Metadata, such as
   channel names, filters applied, extra text for lobby posts, and which
   channels to post in, may also be stored for functionality purposes.

3. **Fetching Data from Discord API**\
   WC3 Live Lobbies may request additional data from the Discord API to verify
   permissions, retrieve metadata such as roles, or facilitate tagging. This
   data is used solely to ensure the bot functions properly and adheres to
   Discord’s permission system.

4. **External Services**\
   WC3 Live Lobbies is hosted on AWS and Deno Deploy, which may temporarily
   handle some data in order to process commands and maintain the bot’s uptime
   and availability. These third-party services may have their own privacy
   policies, but WC3 Live Lobbies does not control how they manage the data.

5. **Public Data**\
   Certain information, such as recent logs of commands and a list of active
   alerts, may be made publicly available for transparency and operational
   purposes. This data does not include personal messages or sensitive
   information but may include metadata about command usage.

6. **No Long-Term Data Storage**\
   WC3 Live Lobbies does not store messages or personal data long-term. Any
   temporary logs or cache are cleared as needed, in line with operational
   requirements.

7. **Data Usage and Retention**\
   The bot only uses the data required to deliver its intended services, such as
   posting lobbies and filtering content. Any stored data is retained only for
   as long as necessary to provide the service and is not shared with third
   parties unless required by law.

By using WC3 Live Lobbies, you consent to the data practices described in this
policy.
